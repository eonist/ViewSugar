/**
 * IMPORTANT: ⚠️️ To understand the relatioship between NSEvent and hitTest: think of NSEvent as going upStream in an inverted pyramid hirarachy and hitTest going downStream in the same hirarachy
 * NOTE: Remember to override the mouseDown method in subclasses if you want to add functionality to the mouseDown action
 * NOTE: Use mouseDragged method if you want to call a method while the mouse is dragged
 * NOTE: If you hi-jack the event handler variable then the parent will not recieve any events. Its better to override onEvent (one could us emany seletors but that would complicate the code. its simple enough to overide onEvent)
 * NOTE: its primary use-case is to wrap NSEvents into Event so that the view hierarchy can retrieve the view where the event came from which is not possible when using NSEvent. NSEvent cant be subclasses so this is the best solution I've found for this particular use-case.
 * CAUTION: ⚠️️ seems to not work as a container for i.e Adding a button to a View instance (for now use FlippedView when using it as a container)
 * TODO: ⚠️️ Make the isChildrenInteractive:Bool -> You may want to make a variable that also can set the isInteractive var of children of the view:
 * IMPORTANT: ⚠️️ you must implement custom hitTest overrides for NSViews added as subViews to this class.
